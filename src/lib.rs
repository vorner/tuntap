//! A TUN/TAP bindings for Rust.
//!
//! This is a basic interface to create userspace virtual network adapter.
//!
//! For basic usage, create an [`Iface`](struct.Iface.html) object and call the
//! [`send`](struct.Iface.html#method.send) and [`recv`](struct.Iface.html#method.recv) methods.
//!
//! You can also use [`Async`](async/struct.Async.html) if you want to integrate with tokio event
//! loop. This is configurable by a feature (it is on by default).
//!
//! Creating the devices requires `CAP_NETADM` privileges (most commonly done by running as root).
//!
//! # Known issues
//!
//! * It is tested only on Linux and probably doesn't work anywhere else, even though other systems
//!   have some TUN/TAP support. Reports that it works (or not) and pull request to add other
//!   system's support are welcome.
//! * The [`Async`](async/struct.Async.html) interface is very minimal and will require extention
//!   for further use cases and better performance.
//! * This doesn't support advanced usage patters, like reusing already created device or creating
//!   persistent devices. Again, pull requests are welcome.
//! * There are no automated tests. Any idea how to test this in a reasonable way?
